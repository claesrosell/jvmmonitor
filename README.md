## Introduction
This is a fork of the jvmmonitor.org project. The ambition of this fork is to maintain it and make it work on JDK9+
JVM Monitor is a Java profiler integrated with Eclipse to monitor CPU, threads and memory usage of Java applications.

JVM Monitor would be useful to quickly inspect Java applications without preparing any launch configuration beforehand. JVM Monitor automatically finds the running JVMs on local host and you can easily start monitoring them. It is also supported to monitor Java applications on remote host by giving hostname and port number.
